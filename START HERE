Before starting to code ml algorithms for trading, you must first understand the basics of trading and the basics of algorithms, I will sum it up for you.

trading : 1.To win you must anticipe other people behaviour 2.You win when others lose 3.People trades with their emotions or their logic
machine learning : 1.There must exist a repetitive pattern for the ml algorithm to learn, if not, the precisi√≥n will be low 2.Data is the key, put all your focus on having quality data 3.Don't overfit or underfit your algorithm
